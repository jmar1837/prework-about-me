      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello world! Welcome to my page. I am new to coding and I am looking forward to gain all the knowledge that this bootcamp has to offer. This journey that I am about to embark on is just the beginning to a new chapter in my life. My first few chapters consist of learning, loving, and growing. I grew up in a small town outside of Palm Springs in Southern California.My family is my everything and having to make a decision to stay or go seemed like a huge decision for a young adult to make. After I graduated high school I moved to Monterey, California to pursue my dream of attending a university by the beach.During my time at <em>California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) </em>I joined a fraternity (Omega Delta Phi), studied abroad in Florence, Italy,  and had a very active social life. After receiving my degree in Human Communication I decided to give my self time to rest and rejuvenate by focusing solely on myself. I worked in the food and beverage industry for some time before I made the switch to education. I am currently a paraprofessional II with the Redlands school district. During my time with the district I have learned so much and have been inspired to continue my education.I hope to learn and continue to grow in this field.  </p>
